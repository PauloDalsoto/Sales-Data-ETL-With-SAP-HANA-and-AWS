# Sales-Data-ETL-With-SAP-HANA-and-AWS
This repository presents an automated data pipeline for ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) of sales data. It utilizes SAP HANA as the database, AWS Glue for transformation, and moves raw data from CSV files to an AWS S3 bucket in a processed format, ready for analysis. The final data is visualized through a BI dashboard for sales insights.
